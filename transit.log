--> Potential ideas/features to implement:
        1) Mac OS like central system and web access point
        2) It just works type of system
        3) Native Support for the Non native softwaret(i.e. windows/linux/macos executables can natively should natively run on this platform)

--> Development
    we will first be making a basic system in 32 bit mode then if that works, we will make the actual 64 bit os.
